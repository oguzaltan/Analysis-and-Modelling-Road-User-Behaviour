The exercise is embedded in the Jupyter notebook "Exercise.ipynb" and was developed based on the conda environment specified in "environment.yml". To run it, you could use one of the following ways:
- Install the environment from conda (you need to have e.g. Miniconda(https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) installed): "conda env create -f environment.yml" and activate it via "conda activate idea-league-chalmers`
- Upload it to Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) (you will also need to upload the files "Event.mat" and "util.py" to the same location, please do _not_ share the data publicly!)
- Have all the packages installed in your local Python installation (see the "environment.yml" file for detailed specifications)

The notebook could be opened, for instance, with the browser via the command "jupyter notebook" or in Visual Studio Code (select the correct interpreter).
