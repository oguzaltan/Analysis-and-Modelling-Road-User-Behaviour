# Analysis and Modelling Road User Behaviour

This [Summer School of IDEA League](https://idealeague.org/analysis-and-modelling-road-user-behavior-22/) is provided by the Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden in September 2022.  

Road crashes are a global concern: The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1.3 million road fatalities occur worldwide every year and road crashes are currently the leading cause of death for people aged 5-29 years. In Europe, although road fatalities have significantly decreased during the period 2009-2019, a less evident reduction has been shown between 2013 and 2019. The current situation calls for more research investigating road-user behavior, to support the design of active safety systems and driving automation systems and for the creation of driverâ€™s training and coaching procedures. With the aim to enhance knowledge on the topic, this course aims to meet the following learning outcomes:

* Explain the importance of analyzing and modelling road-user behavior, for improving road safety.
* Illustrate different types of human factors theoretical driver models.
* Compute relevant quantitative and qualitative metrics, to analyze and model road-user behavior.
* Identify the challenges in the analysis of real-traffic data from naturalistic studies.
* Compare the currently available tools for the virtual evaluation of active safety systems.

Keywords: active safety systems, automated driving, crash causation, human behaviour, naturalistic driving data, safety assessment, vulnerable road users
